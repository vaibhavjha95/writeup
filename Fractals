The screen you are staring at right now sure looks like a rectangle. And the apple you ate this morning is circular. But what if you were to look further, and consider the trees that line the street, the leaves that hang off those trees, the lightning from last nightâ€™s thunderstorm, the cauliflower you ate for dinner, the blood vessels in your body, and the mountains? Most of the stuff you find in nature cannot be described by the idealized geometrical forms of Euclidean geometry. So if we want to start building computational designs with patterns beyond the simple shapes ellipse(), rect(), and line().

The concepts behind and techniques for simulating the geometry of nature: fractals.

What is a fractal?

The term fractal was given by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. According to him a fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.

In easier terms a Fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

Applications of Fractals : 

-->The basic idea of Fractals is to find regularities in the existing irregularities. Below are the applications:

-->Fractal image compression is used in computer science, based on the facts of fractal geometry. By using this technique image is much more compressed as compared to JPEG, GIF, etc. Also, there is no pixelization when the picture is enlarged.

-->To ease the study of turbulent flows, fractal representation is used. Also, fractals are used to represent porous media which is used in petroleum science.

-->Fractal shaped antenna have been recently used which help in reducing the size and the weight of antennas and providing high performance..
